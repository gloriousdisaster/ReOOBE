# Reboot/Resume POC Test v2.0 - CHANGELOG

## Version 2.0 - October 28, 2025

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. **RebootCount Bug Fixed** ✅
**Problem**: RebootCount was showing 0 even after a successful reboot because the increment was lost when `Update-TestState` reloaded the state from disk.

**Solution**: 
```powershell
# Now saves the state immediately after incrementing
$state.RebootCount++
Save-TestState -State $state
Write-TestLog "Reboot count incremented to: $($state.RebootCount)" -Level INFO
```

**Result**: RebootCount will now correctly show `1` after the first reboot.

#### 2. **Post-Reboot Visible Success Window Added** ✅
**Problem**: The console window appeared briefly after reboot but closed too fast for users to see the results.

**Solution**: Added a prominent cyan success message box that appears ONLY after the post-reboot run and waits for user input before closing.

**New Success Window**:
```

║  C:\bin\HMG\logs\reboot-test\                            ║
║                                                          ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Press any key to close this window...
```

**Features**:
- 🎨 Cyan colored box for high visibility
- ✓ Clear success indicator
- 📊 Shows key metrics (reboot count, duration, tasks)
- 📁 Shows log directory location
- ⏸️ **Waits for user keypress** before closing
- 🎯 Only appears after post-reboot run (not on initial run)

### What This Means

**For End Users**:
- After the system reboots and logs in, a **visible cyan window** will appear
- The window clearly shows **"REBOOT/RESUME TEST SUCCESSFUL"**
- Users can read the results before the window closes
- Window stays open until they press any key

**For Developers**:
- RebootCount now accurately tracks reboots
- Easy to verify the test ran post-reboot
- Clear visual confirmation for testing

### Testing the New Version

```powershell
# Copy updated script to test location
Copy-Item "C:\Users\jdore\projects\HMG\hmg_RBCMS\RBCMS\tests\reboot-poc\Test-RebootResume.ps1" `
          "C:\bin\RBCMS\tests\reboot-poc\Test-RebootResume.ps1" -Force

# Run the test
cd C:\bin\RBCMS\tests\reboot-poc
.\Test-RebootResume.ps1
```

### Expected Behavior

**Before Reboot**:
- Standard colored output showing progress
- 30-second countdown
- System reboots

**After Reboot** (NEW!):
- Console window appears automatically
- Shows cyan success box
- **Waits for keypress**
- Closes when user presses any key

### Verification

After running the updated test, verify:

```powershell
# RebootCount should now be 1 (was 0 before)
(Get-Content C:\bin\HMG\logs\reboot-test\test-state.json | ConvertFrom-Json).RebootCount
# Expected: 1

# Results file should also show 1 reboot
Get-Content C:\bin\HMG\logs\reboot-test\test-results.txt | Select-String "Reboots:"
# Expected: Reboots: 1

# Check log for the new increment message
Get-Content C:\bin\HMG\logs\reboot-test\test-*.log | Select-String "Reboot count incremented"
# Expected: [timestamp] [INFO] Reboot count incremented to: 1
```

### Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backwards compatible.

### Files Changed

- `Test-RebootResume.ps1` - Main test script with both fixes

### Migration Notes

If you previously copied the test script to another location, you'll need to re-copy it to get the fixes:

```powershell
# Update your copy
Copy-Item "C:\Users\jdore\projects\HMG\hmg_RBCMS\RBCMS\tests\reboot-poc\Test-RebootResume.ps1" `
          "<your-location>\Test-RebootResume.ps1" -Force
```
